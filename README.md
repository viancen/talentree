# talentree-api
Talentree is the new way of parsing Resume's or Jobs. You simply post a resume or job to us and we will send you back a structured array of data.

Functionality:
- Get structured information about working experience, skills and more
- Parse Resume's
- Parse Job's
- Get scores based on a interpetation of your data instead of flat data.

You will need a API-KEY to use Talentree. Get one at www.eazymatch-online.nl.
